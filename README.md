# Iris Classification

This project involves analyzing and modeling data from a flower classification dataset. The steps include:

# 1. Data Preprocessing
• Loading and Displaying Data: The dataset is loaded and basic information such as the first few rows, summary statistics, and missing values are inspected.
• Label Encoding: The target labels are converted into numerical values for model compatibility.
• Feature Engineering: Additional features are created by calculating areas of the flower's sepals and petals.

# 2. Data Visualization
• Pairplot: Relationships between different features are visualized using pair plots to understand the data distribution.
• Feature Distribution: The distribution of each feature is displayed to gain insights into the data spread.

# 3. Model Training and Evaluation
• Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
• Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest model is trained and evaluated on the testing data. The performance is measured using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.
• Confusion Matrix Visualization: The confusion matrix is visualized to analyze model predictions.

# 4. Neural Network Model
• Model Building: A neural network is constructed with multiple layers, compiled with an optimizer, and trained on the dataset.
• Training Performance: The model's performance is tracked over multiple epochs, and the results are visualized.



This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, using both classical machine learning and neural network approaches.
